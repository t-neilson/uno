# uno simulator

Effectively just runs an AI controlled game of Uno.

Still need to properly handle reverse cards.  More or less functional otherwise.

Would also likely want to go in at a later date to implement better player decision making and to clean up the output.  Could likely go further and add a whole front end to it or implement non-AI player support, although there weren't any plans on pushing that far.
